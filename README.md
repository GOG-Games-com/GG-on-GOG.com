# GG on GOG.com
This userscript adds a "Download from GG" link on the game details of product pages on GOG.com. 

## Usage
- Download an add-on that adds userscript support to your web browser. Violentmonkey for instance ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)/[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag))
- Create a new script
- Copy and paste the code from [gg-on-gog.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nailz776/GG-on-GOG.com/main/gg-on-gog.js) into your new script and save it
- To test, visit a game page on GOG.com (https://www.gog.com/game/flatout) > Game details > Links. "Download from GG" should appear in "Links".

## Issues
Store page URLs and the name of folder slugs for games when you download them differs sometimes, so this won't be 100% accurate.
